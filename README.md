Replication package for the working paper *"When Volatility Masquerades as
Fragility: DeFi Liquidations, Quantile Local Projections, and the Tails of
Ethereum Returns"* by **Paul Engerran**.

This README follows the [Social Science Data Editors template](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/).
It documents the data, code, and exact steps that reproduce every number,
table, and figure in the paper.

## 1. Overview

The leverage-cycle literature predicts that forced deleveraging (liquidations)
should amplify *downside* tail risk. This package tests that prediction for
Ethereum using quantile local projections of hourly ETH returns on a DeFi
liquidation shock, over an hourly panel spanning 2021-03-15 → 2025-11-30 (UTC).

A naive specification appears to confirm the prediction: the response of the
lower return quantiles to a liquidation shock is larger than the median
response and deepens with the horizon. A battery of diagnostics overturns that
reading. A symmetric sign-flip placebo reproduces the entire left-versus-right
tail gap; the response is equally strong in the *upper* tail; the same
signature appears when Bitcoin is the outcome; and permutation nulls show the
long-horizon coefficient is genuine rather than a mechanical artefact of
overlapping cumulative returns. Net of realized volatility, an equivalence
test bounds the downside-*specific* asymmetry below an economically negligible
threshold. What survives is a **symmetric volatility channel**: liquidations
carry incremental out-of-sample predictive content for *both* moderate return
tails at short horizons, though not a substitute for a dedicated volatility model.
The portable methodological caution: *in quantile local projections on
overlapping cumulative returns, symmetric heteroskedasticity can masquerade as
downside fragility.*

The register is **descriptive and predictive, never causal**: at short
horizons the liquidation-return link is mechanically bidirectional, and the
paper makes no causal claim.

**Specification (locked).** Estimand: the quantile-LP coefficient
`β_h(τ)` of the conditional ETH return quantile on the liquidation shock.
Shock: `L_{t-1} = ln(1 + liq_usd_{t-1})`, the one-hour-lagged log USD
liquidation flow (an orthogonalized variant, residual on BTC returns, is used
only for the cross-asset placebo). Quantiles `τ ∈ {0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.50,
0.90, 0.95}` (a nine-quantile grid is reported in the appendix); horizons
`h ∈ {0, …, 24}`. Interaction `L_{t-1} × oi_high_t` carries the leverage-cycle
amplification hypothesis (it is a detectability **null**). Inference: kernel
standard errors at central quantiles; moving-block bootstrap (24-hour blocks,
1,000 replications, seed 42) at the tails.

> **Total compute.** From the shipped analysis panel and the two committed spot
> benchmarks, the full estimation +
> robustness + paper-exhibit regeneration runs in **~40 minutes on a 16-vCPU /
> 32 GB machine** (Path A below). A from-raw rebuild and the extended
> diagnostic battery are longer and optional (Paths B and C).

**Where to start.** Most readers want **Path A** in §6: install the
environment, then `make estimation && make robustness && make paper` from the
committed analysis panel in `data/econ/` plus the two committed spot benchmarks
in `data/normalized/spot/` — no raw-data download is required for Path A.

## 2. Data Availability and Provenance

### 2.1 Rights statement

All inputs are drawn from publicly accessible providers. The package
redistributes only **derived hourly aggregates** (the analysis panels and
result artefacts under `data/econ/`), never raw venue payloads. The author
certifies the right to redistribute these derived artefacts under the MIT
License (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)); the underlying data remain governed by each
provider's terms of use. A formal, journal-format data-availability statement
with full per-source detail is in [`docs/DATA_STATUS.md`](docs/DATA_STATUS.md).

### 2.2 What is in this package vs. what is regenerable

| | Contents | In this repository? |
|---|---|---|
| **Analysis panels + results** | `data/econ/`: two analysis-ready hourly panels plus ~75 result/robustness CSV+JSON artefacts | **Yes** (≈ 15 MB, committed) |
| **Normalized spot benchmarks** | `data/normalized/spot/xrp_ccdata_1h.parquet`, `…/doge_ccdata_1h.parquet`: only normalized inputs the analysis layer reads directly (cross-asset placebo, Test A) | **Yes** (~2.4 MB, committed) |
| **Other raw + normalized inputs** | `data/raw/`, rest of `data/normalized/` (cex, benchmarks, btc/eth spot): raw venue payloads and normalized parquets | **No**, GitHub Release asset **v2.0.0** (unzips at repo root into `data/raw/` + `data/normalized/`; see §6, Path B) |

Because the raw venue payloads and the bulk of the normalized inputs are not
committed, the from-raw panel-building targets (`make data`, `make all`,
`make smoke`) require the Release bundle first. Two normalized spot benchmarks
(`data/normalized/spot/{xrp,doge}_ccdata_1h.parquet`) are the exception: they
are committed because the cross-asset placebo (Test A) reads them directly.
Together with the shipped `data/econ/` panel they make the estimation,
robustness and paper layers (**Path A**) run directly from a fresh clone with no
bundle — those targets guard on the presence of the shipped panel rather than
rebuilding it.

### 2.3 Sources

| # | Source (role) | Provider | Access | Credential | Terms |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | DeFi liquidations (shock) | Dune Analytics, Spellbook `lending.borrow` / `lending.supply` | Re-run query **6912877** via the Dune web UI or API; SQL committed in [`dune_queries/`](dune_queries/) | Free Dune account | Open-source Spellbook; on-chain data public domain |
| 2 | ETH/BTC perpetuals (returns, OI, funding) | Bybit | Public REST `api.bybit.com` | None | Public market data |
| 3 | BTC/ETH/XRP/DOGE spot (benchmarks, placebos) | CCData (CryptoCompare) | `min-api.cryptocompare.com` | **Free API key** via env var `CCDATA_API_KEY` | Free-tier terms; redistribution of derived data permitted |
| 4 | ETH futures (cross-venue diagnostic only) | Binance | Public `fapi.binance.com` | None | Public market data |
| 5 | ETH spot (data-quality audit only) | Coinbase | Public `api.exchange.coinbase.com` | None | Public market data |

Sources 4 and 5 enter no econometric specification; they support a one-off
cross-venue diagnostic and a data-quality audit. The DeFi feed is restricted to
ETH-like collateral and excludes two exploit windows; full filter logic is in
[`dune_queries/liquidations_6912877.sql`](dune_queries/liquidations_6912877.sql)
and [`docs/DUNE_EXTRACTION_BRIEF.md`](docs/DUNE_EXTRACTION_BRIEF.md).

> **Access cost and limitations.** All sources are free. Bybit/Binance/Coinbase
> need no credentials; CCData needs a free-tier key. Dune Spellbook tables are
> community-maintained and may drift marginally as they are rebuilt, so a fresh
> re-extraction of query 6912877 is not guaranteed to be bit-identical to the
> committed panel; the access date is March 2026.

## 3. Dataset list

The committed analysis artefacts live in `data/econ/`. In addition to
`data/econ/`, two normalized spot benchmarks are committed under
`data/normalized/spot/` (`xrp/doge_ccdata_1h.parquet`) because the cross-asset
placebo (Test A) reads them directly. Column-level codebooks
for the two panels are in [`docs/DATA_STATUS.md`](docs/DATA_STATUS.md) §1 and
[`manuscript/appendix/C_data_construction.tex`](manuscript/appendix/C_data_construction.tex).

| File (in `data/econ/`) | Rows × cols | Provided? | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `econ_core_full_1h.parquet` | 41,328 × 27 | Yes | Analysis panel: returns, market-state controls, and the merged liquidation shock (`liq_usd_total`, `log_liq`, `log_liq_lag1`, `oi_high`, …) |
| `econ_core_predefi_1h.parquet` | 41,328 × 22 | Yes | Pre-merge panel (returns + market state, before the DeFi shock is joined) |
| `quantile_lp_results.csv` | varies | Yes | Main quantile-LP estimates `β_h(τ)`, `δ_h(τ)`, SEs |
| `robustness_*.csv`, `placebo_*.csv`, `exceedance_*.csv`, `pure_null_*.csv`, `oos_predictive.csv`, `mde_*.csv`, `skew_test.csv`, `size_ratio.csv`, `descriptive_stats.csv`, … | varies | Yes | ~75 result/robustness artefacts feeding the tables and figures (see §7) |

Raw venue payloads and most normalized parquets are **not** committed (see §2.2);
they are distributed as a GitHub Release asset and are required only for a
from-raw rebuild (Path B). The exception is the two normalized spot benchmarks
`data/normalized/spot/{xrp,doge}_ccdata_1h.parquet`, committed because the
cross-asset placebo (Test A) in Path A reads them directly.

## 4. Computational requirements

- **Language / interpreter.** Python 3.12 (validated on 3.12.2, macOS x86_64,
  and 3.12.3, Linux x86_64). Python 3.13+ is untested; Apple Silicon is
  untested.
- **Operating system.** Linux x86_64 (kernel 6.8, glibc 2.39) is the canonical
  platform. The committed `data/econ/` artefacts were produced there. macOS
  x86_64 reproduces panel construction and the main point estimates bit-for-bit;
  bootstrap statistics drift below one basis point across platforms at fixed
  `--seed 42` (BLAS / joblib worker variance) and never move a sign or shift a
  confidence interval across zero.
- **Dependencies.** Pinned in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) (direct)
  and [`requirements-frozen.txt`](requirements-frozen.txt) (full transitive
  closure). Key pins: `pandas==2.2.2`, `numpy==1.26.4`, `pyarrow==14.0.2`,
  `statsmodels==0.14.2`, `scipy==1.13.1`, `matplotlib==3.10.9`, `joblib==1.4.2`,
  `arch==7.2.0`. No editable install is required (`pyproject.toml` is a minimal
  metadata file; scripts resolve `src/` and `config.py` on `sys.path`).
- **Randomness.** All stochastic steps are seeded; the canonical seed is **42**
  (`run_robustness_all.py --seed 42`). The estimation defaults to `--n_jobs 1`
  for bit-for-bit reproducibility.
- **Determinism policy.** `make reproduce` exports single-thread BLAS
  (`OMP/OPENBLAS/MKL/NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=1`, `VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS=1`) and `PYTHONHASHSEED=0` for
  every step. On the canonical platform a fresh run is **byte-identical** for the
  deterministic numeric artefacts: the main estimation output
  (`data/econ/quantile_lp_results.csv`) is pinned by SHA-256 in
  [`tests/fingerprints.txt`](tests/fingerprints.txt) and enforced by the CI
  `determinism` job (two-pass) and by `make verify-exhibits`. Cross-platform,
  bootstrap/simulation statistics drift below one basis point (never moving a
  sign or shifting a CI across zero). The `*_meta.json` sidecars embed a
  `run_timestamp_utc` and are **provenance-only**, excluded from byte-identity
  checks. Integrity of the shipped data artefacts is checked by `make verify-data`
  against [`data/CHECKSUMS.sha256`](data/CHECKSUMS.sha256).
- **Memory / CPU / disk.** ≥ 16 GB RAM for estimation and figures; ≥ 32 GB
  recommended for the bootstrap battery at `--n_jobs -1`; 16 vCPU for the quoted
  wall times; ≈ 150 MB disk for code + committed artefacts.
- **Environment variable.** `CCDATA_API_KEY` is needed **only** for re-downloading
  raw spot data (Path B); it is read from the environment and never stored. Path A
  needs no API key.
- **Network.** Required only to install dependencies and, for Path B, to
  re-acquire raw data.

**Execution order.** Panel construction (run_data_prep → run_core_panel →
run_defi_merge) is **Path B only** and rebuilds `data/econ/` from the
raw/normalized bundle. The analysis layer — run_quantile_lp → run_robustness_all
→ `scripts/paper/` — is **Path A**: its Make targets guard on the *existence* of
the shipped `data/econ/` panel and do NOT trigger panel construction, so
`make estimation && make robustness && make paper` runs from a fresh clone with
no raw data. Path B targets (`make data`/`make all`) remain file-based; use
`make clean` to force a from-raw rebuild. Each script's full CLI is in its module
docstring (`python scripts/<name>.py --help`).

## 6. Instructions to Replicators

### Install the environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Paul-Engerran/DeFi-Endogenous-Fragility.git
cd DeFi-Endogenous-Fragility
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Path A: reproduce from the shipped analysis panel (recommended)

Everything here runs from artefacts committed to the repo — the `data/econ/`
panel plus the two committed spot parquets in `data/normalized/spot/` (xrp/doge)
feeding the cross-asset placebo (Test A). No raw data, no Release bundle, no
credentials.

```bash
# (optional) run the test suite (data-independent tests run anywhere)
pytest

# 1. Main estimation: quantile-LP coefficients         (~5 min, --n_jobs 1)
make estimation        # → data/econ/quantile_lp_results.{csv,parquet}

# 2. Robustness battery (--tests all, Tests A to N)        (~30 min on 16 vCPU)
make robustness        # → data/econ/robustness_*.csv, se_comparison_*, quantile_*_fast.csv, …

# 3. Paper layer: figures, table fragments, numbers.tex (~2 min)
make paper             # → paper/figures/*.pdf, paper/tables/*.tex, paper/numbers.tex
```

The `placebo_*` / `exceedance_*` diagnostics and the other auxiliary artefacts
consumed by Tables 3–6 and printed Figures 4–8 ship pre-computed in
`data/econ/` and are regenerated only by the multi-hour `make canonical` target.

The manuscript consumes `paper/figures/`, `paper/tables/`, and
`paper/numbers.tex` by relative path; no number is typed by hand. Build the PDF
by compiling `manuscript/main.tex` with a LaTeX engine of your choice
(`make pdf` autodetects latexmk or Tectonic; the committed `manuscript/main.pdf`
was compiled with **Tectonic 0.15.0**).

### Path B: full rebuild from raw data (optional)

This regenerates the analysis panel itself. It requires the raw+normalized
bundle published as GitHub Release **v2.0.0** (the v2.0.0 archive unzips at the
repository root and populates `data/raw/` and `data/normalized/` at the exact
paths `config.py` expects — do not use the older v1.0 asset, whose internal
layout differs). Optionally set a free `CCDATA_API_KEY` only if you prefer to
re-download spot data from CCData instead of using the bundle.

```bash
export CCDATA_API_KEY=...        # only if re-downloading spot from CCData
make smoke                       # Path B only; depends on `make data`, so needs the v2.0.0 bundle; quick end-to-end check on a scratch dir (~1 min)
make all                         # data → estimation → robustness → figures (~35 min, 16 vCPU)
```

### Path C: canonical diagnostic battery (optional, VM)

The extended diagnostic battery (`make canonical`) is intended for a dedicated
VM and takes several hours. See [`RUN_VM.md`](RUN_VM.md) for the procedure and
wall-time ranges.

### Smaller machines

The bootstrap battery is the binding constraint. Lower `--n_jobs` and
`--batch_size`, e.g. on 8 vCPU:

```bash
make estimation
python scripts/run_robustness_all.py --tests all --n_boot 1000 --n_jobs 8
make paper
```

The bootstrap engine checkpoints per batch (`data/econ/_robust_ckpt/`); a run
that is interrupted resumes without recomputing completed batches.

## 7. List of figures, tables, and programs

Every exhibit is regenerated by the paper layer (`make paper`). Figures are
written by `scripts/paper/make_figures.py` (one function per figure) and tables
by `scripts/paper/make_tables.py` (booktabs fragments wrapped by the
manuscript). In-text numbers come from `scripts/paper/make_numbers.py` →
`paper/numbers.tex`. Figure file names (`fig1`…`fig9`, the set skips `fig6`)
are stable artifact identifiers; the numbers LaTeX prints in the compiled paper
follow order of appearance and differ for the last four. The table below is
ordered by the printed number.

| Exhibit | Generator (`script::function`) | Input data (`data/econ/…`) | Manuscript section |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fig. 1, liquidations time series | `make_figures.py::fig1_liquidations_timeseries` | `econ_core_full_1h.parquet` | §2 Data |
| Fig. 2, return distribution | `make_figures.py::fig2_return_distribution` | `econ_core_full_1h.parquet` | §3 Stylized facts |
| Fig. 3, quantile-LP IRF | `make_figures.py::fig3_qlp_irf` | `quantile_lp_results.csv`, `robustness_bootstrap_nb07_spec_fast.csv` | §5 The apparent result |
| Fig. 4, placebo gap distribution | `make_figures.py::fig4_placebo_gap_distribution` | `placebo_symmetric_draws.csv`, `placebo_symmetric.csv` | §6 Deconstruction |
| Fig. 5, dual permutation nulls (file `fig9`) | `make_figures.py::fig9_pure_null_dual` | `pure_null_circular_shift_by_horizon.csv`, `pure_null_innov_shuffle_by_horizon.csv` | §6 Deconstruction |
| Fig. 6, BTC vs. ETH (file `fig8`) | `make_figures.py::fig8_btc_vs_eth` | `btc_vs_eth_profile.csv` | §6 Deconstruction |
| Fig. 7, exceedance symmetry (file `fig5`) | `make_figures.py::fig5_exceedance_symmetry` | `exceedance_results.csv`, `exceedance_paired.csv`, `exceedance_paired_cumulative.csv` | §7 What survives |
| Fig. 8, equivalence (MDE) (file `fig7`) | `make_figures.py::fig7_mde_equivalence` | `exceedance_paired.csv`, `skew_test.csv`, `mde_equivalence.csv` | §7 What survives |
| Table 1, descriptives | `make_tables.py::tab1_descriptives` | `descriptive_stats.csv` | §2 Data |
| Table 2, main quantile-LP | `make_tables.py::tab2_qlp_main` | `quantile_lp_results.csv` | §5 The apparent result |
| Table 3, subsample stability | `make_tables.py::tab3_subsample` | `subsample_stability.csv` | §7 What survives |
| Table 4, exceedance / skew / MDE | `make_tables.py::tab4_exceedance_skew_mde` | `exceedance_paired.csv`, `skew_test.csv`, `mde_equivalence.csv` | §7 What survives |
| Table 5, size ratio | `make_tables.py::tab5_size_ratio` | `size_ratio.csv` | §8 Mechanisms |
| Table 6, out-of-sample | `make_tables.py::tab6_oos` | `oos_predictive.csv` | §7 What survives |
| Table A1, block sensitivity | `make_tables.py::tabA1_block_sensitivity` | `block_sensitivity.csv` | App. B Inference |
| Table A2, SE ratio | `make_tables.py::tabA2_se_ratio` | `se_ratio_nb07.csv` | App. B Inference |

The robustness inputs above (`robustness_*`, `placebo_*`, `exceedance_*`,
`pure_null_*`, `oos_predictive`, `mde_*`, `skew_test`, `size_ratio`,
`subsample_stability`, `block_sensitivity`, `se_ratio_nb07`) are produced by
`run_robustness_all.py --tests all` and the `scripts/aux/` estimators; the
descriptive panel comes from `scripts/aux/run_descriptive_stats.py`. The
cross-asset placebo (Test A) additionally reads the two committed spot parquets
`data/normalized/spot/{xrp,doge}_ccdata_1h.parquet`; these are the only
normalized inputs the analysis layer reads directly (see §2.2/§5). An
extended nine-quantile grid is available via
`run_quantile_lp.py --quantiles 0.01,0.05,0.10,0.25,0.50,0.75,0.90,0.95,0.99
--out_dir /tmp/qlp_9q` (the `--out_dir` matters: without it the run would
overwrite the committed main-results CSV; the committed `*_9q.csv` files are
that run's outputs renamed).
